#  ByteCoin

## Our Goal

The objective of this challenge is to apply the skills I learned in the Climat tutorial and make a Bitcoin price reporter. We are going to revisit how to use URLSession to make HTTP requests and JSONDecoder for JSON parsing. 

## What did I create

We’re going to make a Bitcoin price ticker. The app will give us the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so we can track how well your Bitcoin investments are doing on the go.
